HOTPATCH INSTALLATION
======================

Pre-requisites:

1. CMake: You need to have cmake 2.6 or above installed.
2. Compilers: gcc is needed along with standard headers.
3. GNU Make: make is needed to build the code.


How to install:

Release build:

$ make
$ make test
$ make install

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/install

Debug build:

$ make debug
$ make testdebug
$ make installdebug

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make installdebug PREFIX=/path/to/install
